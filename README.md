# lagou-company-page
This is a imitation of the http://www.lagou.com/gongsi/.
The imitated page doesn't have a responsive design. But my work has one, using flex box module.
Cause flex is a new feature of CSS3, my web page can't be fully supported in IE11. 
But it goes well on other latest popular browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox and Opera.
